## How to start a project?

#### 1. Find a place to do an internship

#### 2. Find a supervisor of the MSc Geomatics

The Geomatics Supervisor may be any person connected to the Geomatics programme with sufficient knowledge of your chosen topic.

#### 3. Complete an Internship Proposal form 

It needs to be submitted (max 800 words) according to the [provided template](download/GEO5016_Internship_application_form_2025.docx).

The Internship Proposal form can be sent by mail to the GEO5016 coordinator [Jantien Stoter](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter/) (<mailto:j.e.stoter@tudelft.nl>).

The GEO5016 Coordinator will assess your Internship Proposal for suitability for the Geomatics programme. 
A GO will be granted when the internship Coordinator is satisfied that the proposed topic and activities are suitable for the Geomatics Programme and at MSc level, i.e., there has to be an academic challenge. This means that you have to work towards tackling a problem, working with complex and heterogeneous geospatial data, or developing a model or something similar, either individually or as part of a team. So, just carrying out activities according to fixed protocols without a personal contribution is not sufficient. Without a GO, you are not allowed to start this internship. 

#### 4. When you receive a go 

Submit a UNL Internship Agreement, signed by you and your Workplace Supervisor, to <mailto:J.vanOs@tudelft.nl> with a CC to the GEO5016 Coordinator. 
The Internship Agreement form can be downloaded in Dutch and English from <https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/onderwerpen/onderwijs/gemeenschappelijke-stageovereenkomst-universiteiten>.
